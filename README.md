# BugLogger API

This is the backend for my Full-stack CRUD app built for bug logging and searching. I built this app for fun and to practice integrating a Ruby on Rails  API with a React project. 

### Functionality

App has full user authentication and authorization via Rails' in-built sessions. 

A User can create a project and then add bug logs for that particular project; CRUD functionality allows a User to edit, delete and search their logs. 

A User can also view the logs of other Users and leave an 'upvote' or 'downvote' -  User cannot rate their own logs. 

A User can search via keywords their own logs and that of other users.
