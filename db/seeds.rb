# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.destroy_all
# Log.destroy_all

# user = User.create(email: "ryaboug@gmail.com", password: "Lebanon1", password_confirmation: "Lebanon1")
# log = Log.create(bugTitle: "first Log", bugDescription: "desc.", languagesInvolved: "js,ruby", links: "a,b,c", solution: "x,y,z", notes: "notes here", user_id: user.id )
